Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

- Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to concrete factory classes

- The client code calls the creation methods of a factory object instead of creating products directly with a constructor call (**new** operator).
